# Analyzing-baby-names

The United States Social Security Administration collects information about Baby Names for every newborn in the United States. This dataset (available on a national and state-wide basis) gives us a chance to look into some naming trends. Have some names gone outdated? Were there certain periods some names were more popular than others? What do the answers to these questions tell us about the way we choose to name? This report aims to take a look at a few of these questions.
